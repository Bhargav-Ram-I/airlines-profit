# Flight Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes flight data to uncover insights related to flight performance, delays, and other factors that affect air travel. The dataset contains various attributes related to flights, such as flight codes, departure and arrival times, delays, and more. Using this data, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation analysis, and visualize patterns through heatmaps and graphs.

## Project Description
The primary objective of this project is to analyze a dataset containing flight information. We will explore relationships between different variables using correlation matrices and visualizations. Key steps include:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Performing correlation analysis
- Visualizing the correlation matrix using heatmaps
- Investigating patterns related to flight delays and other variables

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate into the project directory.
3. It is recommended to create a virtual environment.
4. Activate the virtual environment.
5. Install the necessary dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file.

### Requirements
The required libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`. You can generate this file using `pip freeze`.

## Usage

Once you've installed the dependencies, you can run the analysis on your dataset.

1. Place your Excel file (e.g., `flight_data.csv`) in the project directory.
2. Modify the file path in the code to point to your Excel dataset.

### Running the Analysis
To start the analysis, simply run the command for your script. This will:
1. Load the dataset.
2. Clean the data and handle any missing values.
3. Perform correlation analysis and display a heatmap of the correlations between numerical features.

## Data Description
The dataset consists of the following columns:
- **Flight_Code**: Unique identifier for the flight (e.g., 'FL885').
- **Departure_Time**: Scheduled departure time of the flight.
- **Arrival_Time**: Scheduled arrival time of the flight.
- **Delay**: The delay in minutes (if any) for the flight.
- **Distance**: Distance covered by the flight in miles.
- **Airline**: The airline operating the flight.
- **Flight_Status**: The status of the flight (e.g., 'On Time', 'Delayed').
